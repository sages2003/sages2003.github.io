        <h2>about me!</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="textblock1">
        <p>I was born in Washington D.C. on April 2nd 2003.</p>
        <p>I live in North West, with my mom(an art history teacher), dad(a financial analyst), and my 14 year old brother.</p>
        <p>I've attended Maret School, a small private school, since kindergarten, in which I've developed my interests in math and science.</p>

        <p>During the fall, I play for both my travel soccer team and also my school's varsity team. I've been playing soccer since I was 4, and travel since I was 10. </p>
        <p>I also do track in the spring, my first season being this year ('19).</p>
        <p>
            <b>I've been passionate about coding ever since it was incorporated into my school's math program. It is now an integral part of our math grade, accounting for up to 40% of our yearly grade.</b> Up until SAMS, I knew how to code only in python. Being able to code has increased my ability to problem solve, arguably as much as all the math classes I'
            ve taken in my high school career. The more I learn about code, the more eager I am to learn more and explore the endless possible ways to utilize it.
        </p>
        <p>Fufilling my arts requirment this year introduced me to a new passion: photography. My school's photography program provides its students with old school film cameras, so all our photos have to be rolled, developed and printed by hand. Although it can be a tedious process, darkroom photography serves as my creative outlet when I feel overwhelmed by school and my other daily responsibilites. </p>

            <p>it's time to flex....</p>
            <p>During the 2018-2019 soccer season I won an All-State award for my league.</p>
            <p>I was awarded with a silver medal in the Nation Scholastics competition in May 2019.</p>
            <p>I was also ranked amongst the top 5 runners for the 100-400m dashes in the D.C., Maryland, Virginia area.</p>

        <h2>my favorite places in D.C!</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock4">
        <p>when I tell people I live in D.C. they always ask me what my favorite parts or places to go so here ya go.</p>
        <p>1. the national mall(duh). specifically the National Gallery(i grew up going to muesuems with my mom, so this being a favorite is largely her influence).</p>        <p>2. georgetown. it's a really popular spot for tourists who are into shopping, but the waterfront is really gorgeous and you can see the Kennedy Center, and Virginia across the river. There are lots of spots you can sit, but there is also a variety of restaurants, a movie theater, and other little shops. </p>        <p>3. chinatown. chinatown has the Capital One Center, where all the big concerts and sports events. but chinatown is also home to the National Portrait Gallery, and a diverse handful of shops and restaurants. The architecture and unique color scheme makes the area exude culture and complexity</p>
